## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project


Please have fun checking out these website optimisation.  I am hosting the Cameron website [here](http://wjkenney.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio-master/index.html)

Here is a list of some of the optimizations I have included: 

..* added async tags to all non-dom manipulating scripts
..* Separated non essential css into a separate stylesheet with a media print tag)
..* reduced image file size
..* Minifyd http css and javascript and inlining everything into one file. 

Here is a list of optimizations the pizza website: 
 ..* rewrote unnecessary and repetitive function calls from loops: example: document.querySelector("#pizzaSize").innerHTML)
 ..* Reduced the usage of layout inducing methods like scrollTop and Offsetwidth. They are only called when necessary.
 ..* used transform property for animation instead of width.  Supposedly it is better. 

 I also changed the structure of the rendering to rely on a movingpizza class to produce the icons.  Not sure if this did anything useful for the website.
